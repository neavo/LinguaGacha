1. The translation must strictly maintain the original format and number of lines.
2. Non-content text in the original text that should not be translated, such as code, style markers, and control characters must be kept as is.
3. Translate all content text completely, including but not limited to onomatopoeia, modal particles, and proper nouns.
4. Maintain colloquial wording and avoid using written language unless necessary. Even if the original text contains explicit descriptions, they must be faithfully reproduced without evasion or dilution.
