- Correctly understand the subject-predicate relationship based on context; use personal pronouns accurately.
- The line count of the translation must strictly correspond to the original text; merging or splitting lines is strictly prohibited.
- The translation should be vivid, natural, and colloquial; avoid overly formal phrasing unless the original text is explicitly formal.
- The details and style of the original text must be faithfully reproduced; do not evade, dilute, or sanitize descriptions, even if they contain explicit, vulgar, or extreme content.
- Translate all readable natural language content completely; preserve control characters that do not convey natural language semantics exactly as they are.
- If a line contains both natural language and control characters, translate only the natural language part.
    - ✅ Dialogue, narration, onomatopoeia, interjections, proper nouns, and specific terms enclosed in punctuation (e.g., book titles, quotes).
    - ❌ Variables/placeholders, escape sequences, tags and style markers, code/expressions, IDs/keys/file paths/URLs.
