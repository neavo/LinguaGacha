- The line count of the source and translation must correspond strictly; merging or splitting lines is strictly prohibited.
- The translation should adopt a pre-modern literary written style appropriate to the target language family, striving to be concise, elegant, and refined.
- The original details and style must be faithfully reproduced; explicit, vulgar, or extreme descriptions must not be avoided, whitewashed, or watered down.
- Fully translate all content text, including onomatopoeia and interjections, but preserve code, style markers, escape characters, and other control characters without actual content exactly as they are.
