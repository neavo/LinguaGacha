Task Requirements:
1.Translate the text line by line, ensuring the translated text has the same number of lines as the original, without splitting or merging lines.
2.Preserve the original formatting, symbols, code, and special styles from the original text in the translation. Do not translate these elements, especially code segments in the format of [...] and {...}.
3.Maintain a colloquial style, prioritize literal translation, and if necessary, allow for blunt or vulgar phrasing. Do not avoid or dilute anything, faithfully and accurately representing the original work.
